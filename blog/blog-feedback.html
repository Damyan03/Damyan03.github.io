                    <h2>First feedback</h2>

                    <h3>Hi Damyan,</h3>

                    <p>Find some feedback for your PCO assignment below</p>

                    <h3>Motivation:</h3>

                    <p> On of the motivations I read here is the need for becoming an expert and have people
                        ask you for advice and help. I would also like to ask why do you want to learn how to program.
                        What about it is it you really like? Why in Middelburg?
                    </p>

                    <h3>Job:</h3>

                    <p> I would advise you to select a couple of companies for PCO who are completely different but all
                        have software developers on board to get an idea of possibilities and variety of work Select
                        three you gravitate towards to really get an idea about the jobs out there and which ones appeal
                        to you wanting to be an expert where people turn to! so you can make better decisions and
                        formulate your motivation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>SWOT:</h3>

                    <p>
                        What makes you believe they do not fully understand what you mean? and how could this become an
                        issue for study success? What can you put into place of actively work on to help you? How can
                        you keep close contact with home or meet up with fellow students from your home country to keep
                        you motivated?
                    </p>

                    <h3>Questions:</h3>

                    <p>
                        I believe your question on the schedule has been answered by now also keep in mind to
                        find the studies execution regulations for PCO with al the information on courses!
                    </p>
